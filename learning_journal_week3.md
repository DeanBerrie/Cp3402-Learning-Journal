### Estimated Hours
This week I spent 5 hours on this subject.
### Content Insights
Through this practical, I learned the basics of how WordPress works as a content management system. I became familiar with the dashboard, including how to create pages, edit content, install themes, and manage plugins.
I learned that WordPress themes control the design of the website, while plugins add extra functionality such as contact forms or SEO tools. Compared to Joomla, I found WordPress more intuitive and easier to navigate, especially when creating and editing pages.
I also learned how important it is to structure a site properly from the beginning, including setting menus and page hierarchy, as this makes the site easier to use and manage later.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This task helped me understand a widely used industry tool, as WordPress is one of the most popular CMS platforms used by businesses and freelance developers. Having basic experience with WordPress will be valuable for future employment, especially in web design or digital content roles.
Working through the practical also showed me that hands-on learning is the most effective way for me to understand web development tools. Setting up the site myself and troubleshooting issues helped me build confidence in using WordPress.
The group formation activity also helped me understand what myself and others are looking for when completing assignment two and is gave an idea on who I want to group up with.
Overall, this week helped me build a strong foundation in WordPress and better understand how CMS platforms are used in real-world web development projects.
