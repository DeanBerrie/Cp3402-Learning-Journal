# Week 4 Learning Journal

### Learning Activities & Resources
- This week was about setting up a local environment to run wordpress on. So for this week I researched and understood docker containers and their uses and implementations. I also saw that in learnjcu the tutorial for setup in the lecture videos used vagrant with virutalbox, so I also experimented setting up the local environment using this tool aswell to compare advantages and disadvantages of both.

### Estimated Hours
- This week I spent 2 to 3 hours with self directed learning.
### Content Insights
- This week gave me a much clearer understanding of how local development environments work and why they are important. Using Docker showed me how containerisation can simplify setup and ensure consistency across different systems. I also gained more confidence working with databases in WordPress and understanding how dynamic content is generated from stored data. Exploring Vagrant as an alternative also helped me understand that there are multiple valid approaches to environment setup, each with their own advantages depending on the project requirements.

### Career / Employability / Learning Insights
- From a learning perspective, I found that setting up the environment myself (including troubleshooting errors) helped me understand the underlying systems much better than just following step-by-step instructions. Similar to previous weeks, I found that attempting the practical first, encountering problems, and then referring back to documentation and tutorials was the most effective way for me to learn. Next week to improve my learning flow I want to try spending a bit more time learning ahead for the content just to prepare/understand what is required to be learnt the next week.
