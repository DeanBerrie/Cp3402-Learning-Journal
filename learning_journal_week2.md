# Week 2

### Learning Activities and Resources
- This week I was focused on deepening my knowledge on the uses and functions of content managment systems while also learning the advantages and disadvantages of some of the most popular content managment systems.
- Resources I used are as follows:
- https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/uc-cms-comparison/
- https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/content-management-system

### Estimated Hours
- This week I would have spent 4 hours of my own time on this subject.

### Content Insights
- Understanding how CMS's work and the advantages/disadvantages is important to build a baseline knowledge of what we will be doing in future pracs and assignments. Before starting the practical on joomla I also researched the basic fundamentals of joomla, and how to properly navigate the service before using it.  

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- Being able to understand the uses of each of the most popular CMS's and how to use them will be very useful in creating websites in the future, having the baseline knowledge of a few of the most popular CMS's is vital as different companies use different CMS's and being able to easily use a variety of these content management systems will be important. From incorporating a research first approach this week I found the completion of the practical was easier and deepened my understanding of the content, however in the future I think it would be best to go back to what I learnt a few days after the practical to properly remember what I learnt.
