# Week 1 Learning Journal

### Learning Activities & Resources
- This week I focused on re-learning and revising HTML and CSS code from resources such as W3Schools, and the lecture videos on LearnJCU. I did this during and after the practical, revising the content as I used it in practice.

### Estimated Hours
- I Spent around 2.5 Hours of time learning through this week
### Content Insights
-Revising HTML and CSS was a really important starting point for working with content management systems, because it refreshed the core web design knowledge that CMS platforms are built on. It reminded me of key design principles such as call to action, colour theory, and UI/UX design, and how these are actually implemented through code.
While I still remembered the basic HTML and CSS I used previously (such as headings, paragraphs, images and links), I realised there were some gaps in my knowledge. In particular, I needed to revise HTML elements that I hadn’t used as often before, like forms with different input types (radio buttons, text areas, etc.). I also needed to re-learn parts of CSS such as layout spacing, margin, and padding to properly structure pages.
This showed me that even though CMS platforms make building websites easier, understanding the underlying HTML and CSS is still important for making better design decisions, customising content, and fixing issues when they come up.

### Career / Employability / Learning Insights
- After completing the practical, I realised I was a bit out of practice with HTML and CSS, which slowed me down at the start. To improve this, I went back through W3Schools and my previous web design work to refresh my knowledge and fill in areas I had forgotten.
One thing I learned from this week is that my approach to learning needs to improve. I started the practical before fully revising the required content, which meant I was trying to learn and complete the task at the same time. This made the process take longer and reduced how much I actually understood. In the future, I will review the content first before attempting the practical so I can complete tasks more efficiently and with a deeper understanding.
From an employability perspective, this week showed me the importance of keeping technical skills up to date. Even though CMS platforms are commonly used in industry, employers still expect a strong understanding of HTML and CSS for customisation, troubleshooting, and improving user experience. Continuing to develop these skills will make me more confident and better prepared for roles in web design and digital content.
