# Week 1 Learning Journal

### Learning Activities & Resources
- This week I focused on re-learning and revising HTML and CSS code from resources such as W3Schools, and the lecture videos on LearnJCU. I did this during and after the practical, revising the content as I used it in practice.

- https://www.w3schools.com/
- https://www.learn.jcu.edu.au

### Estimated Hours
- I Spent around 2.5 Hours of time learning through this week
### Content Insights
- Revising HTML and CSS was a good start to Content managment systems as it helped me to remember web design principles that I had previously learnt in subjects like web design. These principles and features of website design such as call to action, colour theory, and ui/ux design, that will be essential when working with CMS's.  

### Career / Employability / Learning Insights
- Even after completing the practical, I felt a bit out of touch with the html and css I learnt to I went back through w3schools guides and also through my previous work on web design to jog my memory and to expand on a little that wasn't taugh in web design, which may be useful in the future with possible employement. In the future I think it would be best to wait a while before jumping into the prac and learn the content needed before the prac. Doing it this way will allow me to more in depth learn what I need instead of learning while im doing the prac taking more time and learning less.
